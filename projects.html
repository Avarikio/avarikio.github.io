  <h1>Selected Projects</h1>
    <h2>Honeybadger Ultralight</h2>
      <p>A hybrid-electric, single seat ultralight aircraft project, designed to Canadian Advanced Ultra-Light Aeroplane regulations. The completed aircraft will feature monocoque construction, 
        a hybrid gasoline/electric drive located amidships, cruising at 120 knots with a range of approximately 500 nautical miles. An all-electric endurance of 30 minutes at maximum power is expected,
        enabling either electric assistance at takeoff or quiet electric flight in the terminal phases of flight for operation in noise-restricted areas. See the project page for more detailed information.

    <h2>Third Thumb Prosthesis</h2>
      <p>Bracelet with integrated sensors, actuators, and structure supporting addition of a "third thumb" for dexterity improvements.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Adaptive Planform Development Code</h2>
      <p>Interfacing with Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL), uses a simplified genetic algorithm to develop wing and tail planforms for the conceptual development of aircraft, to specified performance and stability coefficients.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Radio Control Aircraft</h2>
      <p>A variety of 3D printable radio-control aircraft. Some scale models of real aircraft, some developed ex nihilo. See specific aircraft for details.</p>
